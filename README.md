# IoT_JemsBond
IoT_JemsBond  iot vulnerability scanner tool
#This code will scan all IoT devices on the network for known vulnerabilities. The list of known vulnerabilities is stored in the KNOWN_VULNERABILITIES list. The code first checks the device's firmware version for known vulnerabilities. If a vulnerability is found, it is added to the list of vulnerabilities. The code then prints the list of vulnerabilities for each device.

To run this code, you will need to install the requests and re Python modules. You can do this by running the following command:




pip install requests re




Once you have installed the modules, you can run the code by saving it as a Python file and then running it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as iot_vulnerability_scanner.py, you can run it by running the following command:


python IoT_JemsBond.py




This will scan all IoT devices on the network for known vulnerabilities and print the list of vulnerabilities for each device.
